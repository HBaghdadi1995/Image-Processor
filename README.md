# Image-Processor

## Aim

An image processor that applies a 3x3 Convolution Matrix, with the option of using either a single processor, multiple processor or GPGPU. It was created using C++, C# and OpenCL.

## Skills Demonstarted

A list of the skills demonstrated in the codebase.

* Interpretation of convolution Matrix both in C# and OpenCL.

### C#/.net

* Multi processing

* DLL Importing

### OpenCL

* Basic OpenCL Skills

* Algorithm that doesn't use branching implemented, this is done to take advantage of GPU architecture.
